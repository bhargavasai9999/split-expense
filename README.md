# Automated Attendance System by Facial Recognition Using CCTV

## Project Overview

In today's fast-paced world, the need for efficient and accurate attendance tracking systems is essential for educational institutions, businesses, and organizations. Traditional methods of taking attendance, such as manual roll calls or card swiping, are time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies. This project presents an automated attendance system employing facial recognition technology based on CCTV video.

## Introduction

The Automated Attendance System using CCTV is supported by robust frameworks like PyTorch and OpenCV, and powered by advanced facial recognition algorithms, including FaceNet, VGG-16, MTCNN, and YOLOv8. The system uses CCTV cameras to capture real-time video footage, process it for facial recognition, and accurately record attendance.

## Motivation

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has gained prominence for its ability to analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions without explicit programming. Integrating CCTV cameras with ML frameworks and advanced facial recognition algorithms can revolutionize attendance management by automating the identification and tracking of individuals.

## Problem Statement

Traditional attendance marking systems in educational institutions and workplaces are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack real-time monitoring. Additionally, manual attendance processes can lead to proxy attendance and do not provide insights into attendance patterns. The automated system aims to address these issues by accurately identifying individuals and marking their attendance in real-time.

## Objectives

- **Automated Attendance Recording**: Automatically and accurately record attendance through CCTV video analysis.
- **Efficiency and Time Savings**: Streamline attendance management processes, reducing administrative burdens.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for administrators to monitor and retrieve attendance reports.
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Implement measures to protect attendance data and ensure privacy compliance.

## System Specifications

### Software Specifications

- **Operating System**: Windows 10
- **Coding Language**: Python 3.9
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Back-End**: Python 3.9, Flask

### Hardware Specifications

- **Processor**: Intel Processor i5 (7th gen or above)
- **GPU**: Minimum 1GB (Supports CUDA)
- **RAM**: 8 GB (Higher recommended)
- **Storage**: 512 GB SSD
- **Camera**: 2 Megapixel

## Design and Implementation

The system architecture integrates CCTV cameras with facial recognition technology. It utilizes PyTorch for deep learning, OpenCV for image and video processing, and Flask for the backend framework. The system includes various UML diagrams such as Use Case, Class, Sequence, Component, and Deployment diagrams to illustrate the design.

### Key Components

- **Facial Recognition**: Uses algorithms like FaceNet, VGG-16, MTCNN, and YOLOv8 for high accuracy.
- **Backend**: Flask handles HTTP requests and integrates with the facial recognition module and PostgreSQL database.
- **Frontend**: Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for an intuitive user interface.

## Results

The system effectively automates attendance recording, providing real-time tracking and substantial benefits for educational institutions, organizations, and security applications. Screenshots of the output, including the login page, dashboard, and attendance management, are included to demonstrate the system's functionality.

## Conclusion

The automated attendance system streamlines attendance management, reduces administrative burden, and provides real-time reports for decision-making. Ongoing updates are recommended to improve accuracy and reliability.
